// In OOP:
// 1) Everything is an object, an object is a block of memory allocated and configured accordingly to design and intended behavior. From the problem space you need to solve
//you take everything you need and create objects from them
// 2) Objects communicate through sending and receiving messages ( in terms of objects) : The program will be a set of objects performing different actions calling methods
// that are implemented
// 3) Objects have their own memory: you can create objects by composing other objects
// 4) Every object is an instance of a class (which must be an object): Think of class as a blueprint of an object about what it can do
/*
* 5) Classes holds the shared behavior for all its instances: this means, all objects of a particular type can receive the same messages / expose the same methods
*
*
* Kotlin support all of this and also the three pillar of OOP, inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism. Inheritance: create a new class from existing one
* Encapsulation: a group of related fields and methods are treated as an object
* Polymorphism: can use different classes interchangeably despite the fact that each one implements the same methods differently
*
* Also we need to provide the following, Simplicity, Modularity, Modifiability, Extensibility, Reusability
* Simplicity: Objects need to abstract the real world reducing complexity and streamlining the program structure
* Modularity: Each objects internal working mechanisms are decoupled from the other parts of the program
* Modifiability: Change inside an object doesn't affect other parts of the program
* Extensibility: Objects need to change fast if they model the real world and must respond quickly and efficiently to those changes
* Reusability: Objects can be used in other programs
*

// Static methods and companion objects

// Static methods doesn't belong to the object but to the class itself, Kotlin doesn't support those!
// it is advisable to define methods at package level to achieve this functionality
// We can define a new kotlin file and name it Static so that the function inside it works as Static Functions

//Singletons : Limit the instantiation of a given class to a single object, once created it will live through the program
